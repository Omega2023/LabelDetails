This project was converted from C#, it is a Serial Barcode Reader Application that will check to see if a COM Port exists. It will Open the Port, Read data, and Close the Port when it is done.

Then a Delegate is used to write to a UI control from a non-UI thread.

If an error occurs, it will automatically write the error to a log file. If the log file directory doesn't exist, it will create one and write to it.

It is a working application and has been fully tested.

It was built on Visual Studio 2013.

If you are using an earlier version of Visual Studio, you can easily downgrade it with no loss of functionality.
